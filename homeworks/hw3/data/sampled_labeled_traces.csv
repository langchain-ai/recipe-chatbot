- 2 medium sweet potatoes
- 4 large eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- Optional: chopped herbs (like parsley or chives), chopped veggies (like bell peppers or spinach), or cooked bacon bits for extra flavor

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the oven:** Set your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with silicone liners or lightly grease it with coconut oil to prevent sticking.

2. **Prepare sweet potatoes:** Wash and peel the sweet potatoes. Use a grater or a food processor with a grating attachment to shred the sweet potatoes into small, fine pieces.

3. **Squeeze out moisture:** Place the grated sweet potatoes in a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth and squeeze out excess moisture. This helps keep the muffins from becoming too watery.

4. **Fill the muffin cups:** Divide the shredded sweet potatoes evenly among the muffin cups, pressing them down slightly to form a base that lines the bottom and sides of each cup.

5. **Add eggs:** In a bowl, beat the eggs with salt, pepper, and any optional herbs or veggies you'd like. Pour the beaten eggs over the sweet potato layers in each muffin cup, filling about 3/4 full.

6. **Bake:** Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the edges are slightly golden.

7. **Cool and store:** Let the muffin cups cool for a few minutes. Remove from the tin and place in an airtight container. These store well in the fridge for up to 3 days.

#### To serve:
